				Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its surface is covered with frozen methane (CH4). This reflects blue light from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, Uranus also has a ring. The most notable feature of Uranus is that its axis is tilted about 90 degrees from their orbit around the Sun.

Uranus was discovered by William Herschel in 1781. At first, he thought it might be a star or comet. He then saw that it moved faster than the stars and was in fact another planet.

Uranus has 15 known moons. Their names were all taken from Shakespearean plays. Only the closest to the planet, Cordelia, is within the ring system of Uranus. Uranus' known moons are (from nearest to furthest from the planet): Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Belinda, Puck, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.

In 2004, the Cassini probe will reach Saturn. The probe will also send a smaller probe to Titan's surface.

William Herschel named Uranus after the mythological Greek goddess of astronomy, Urania.

Uranus did not have a perfect orbit around the Sun. Its path showed irregularities (called perturbations). Astronomers realized that these must have been the effect of a more distant planet.
