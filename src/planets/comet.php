A sphere of comets surrounds our Solar System in what is called the Oï¿½rt Cloud, named after astronomer Jan Oort, who proposed its existence. This spherical cloud contains about 10,000,000,000,000 (ten American trillion) comets. Sometimes a comet will leave the Oort Cloud and travel towards the Sun. When they are near the Sun, they develop tails and we can often see them from Earth.

Comets contain ice. When a comet approaches the Sun, some of its ice melts and forms a tail. This comet tail also contains a combination of water vapor and dust. The tail usually appears as two tails: a bluish tail of gas, and a whitish tail of dust particles. The tail only exists when a comet is close to the Sun.

When the Earth passes through the remains of a comet's tail, we have meteor showers.

The most famous comet is Halley's Comet, named after the astronomer who discovered its regular orbit. Halley's Comet orbits around the Sun in approximately 76 years. It is visible from the Earth when close to the Sun. Halley's Comet last came closest to the Sun in 1986, and will return in 2061.

The Hale-Bopp Comet was the last comet visible by the unaided eye, in 1997.

In December 2003, the Encke Comet was visible with binoculars in the Aquila constellation.

On 2 January 2004, the Stardust probe successfully traveled right through the head of the Wild 2 Comet and collected a sample of its dust. The probe will then return to Earth and send a capsule containing this sample back to Earth in January 2006. This is the first sample taken from a comet. Scientists believe that comets haven't changed much since the Solar System was first formed, so this is an exciting event in the world of astronomy.
