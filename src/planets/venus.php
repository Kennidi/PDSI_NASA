				Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun. That, and its permanent cloud cover that reflects sunlight, makes Venus the brightest planet seen from the Earth. The atmosphere of Venus is poisonous carbon dioxide with sulfuric acid clouds. Venus orbits the Sun in about 245 days. Its day (243 Earth days) is almost as long as its year, and it spins on its axis in the reverse direction that the Earth spins. The photo on the left shows an ultraviolet image of Venus from the Hubble Space Telescope. Ultraviolet and infrared imaging are more difficult on Earth because the atmosphere absorbs much ultraviolet light, and because the Earth itself has infrared heat.

Like Mercury, Venus is close to the Sun and so we can only see it before sunrise or after sunset. However, it can appear further above the horizon than Mercury.

Venus reflects about 80% of the sunlight that reaches it, because of its cloud cover. That's more than ten times what our Moon reflects. However, our Moon appears brighter because it is closer. Venus comes closer to the Earth than any other planet, and appears to be the second brightest object in the night sky. Because of its closeness, astronomers on Earth can easily see the phases of Venus with binoculars. The new crescent phase appears when Venus is closest to the Earth.

Because it is so bright, the ancient Greeks and Romans named Venus after their mythological goddess of Love.
