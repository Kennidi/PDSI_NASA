The Moon orbits around our Earth. It is very small compared to the planets, but appears large because it is so close to the Earth. The Moon orbits the Earth in 27.3 days. The Moon orbits around its axis at the same rate as it orbits around the Earth. Because of this, the same part of the Moon always faces the Earth. We call the part that does not face the Earth the Dark Side of the Moon.

Our planet's Moon is the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System. Only three moons of Jupiter (Ganymede, Callisto, and Io) and Saturn's moon Titan are larger. The Moon's gravitational pull on the Earth is so strong that it affects our ocean's tides.

As the Moon orbits around the Earth, it changes position relative to the Sun. During this "lunar month," the Moon goes through its phases.

The Moon is the only other body in the Solar System where man has walked. The Apollo missions of the United States in th 1960s fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's sentiment that the United States could land a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Apollo astronauts gathered rock samples and brought them back to Earth â€” and planted the American flag on the Moon. The United States is the only country to land astronauts on the Moon.
