				Our Sun contains mostly hydrogen and helium atoms. Gravity holds these atoms together. Hydrogen atoms (with one proton in their nucleus) are converted into helium atoms (with two protons in their nucleus). The reaction that produces this fusing of atoms is called "nuclear fusion." Protons from hydrogen atoms are so close in the Sun that they "fuse" together. The tremendous energy that nuclear fusion in the Sun creates produces the Sun's light and heat.

The temperature in the Sun's center (the core) is about 27,000,000 (27 million) degrees Farenheit (about 15 million degrees Centigrade). The surface temperature is about 6,100 degrees Centigrade. The surface temperature of our Sun and other stars determine the type of visible light they produce. This is known as the "color temperature." As a perfect black body (known as a Planck Black Body) heats, it becomes infrared, then visible red. As it heats more, it turns orange, then yellow. As it heats still more, it generates more blue light than red or green. Finally, it shifts towards ultraviolet light.

The ratio of blue to green to red light indicates an object's "color temperature." A 100-Watt tungsten bulb has a color temperature of about 2900 degrees (much cooler than the Sun's color temperature of 6100 degrees). If you take a picture indoors at night using tungsten bulbs with daylight film, it appears yellow. The color temperature is why. Tungsten bulbs don't have as much blue light as sunlight. Electronic flashes have more blue light than tungsten bulbs, so their light looks natural on daylight film. Ordinary daylight film is usually balanced for a color temperature of 5500 degrees. Electronic flash equipment typically looks like it has a color temperature of 5000-6000 degrees Centigrade.

Different stars have different color temperatures. If you photograph stars with daylight film (using a long enough exposure), you'll see that some stars appear reddish and orange. Those stars are cooler than our Sun. Others appear bluish. Those stars are hotter than our Sun. Stars that appear white on daylight film have a color temperature of about 5500 degrees, and so are about the same surface temperature as our Sun. One interesting constellation to photograph to see different star colors is Orion. See the "Comets" section below and look at the different colors of the stars in the picture. The blue ones are hotter than the orange ones.

Our Sun is about 4,600,000,000 (4.6 American billion) years old. Slowly over these billions of years, the Sun's hydrogen is converted into helium. Hydrogen atoms have one proton in their nucleus. Helium atoms have two protons. As more of the hydrogen converts into helium, the Sun expands. Our Sun will expand to become a "red giant" in about 5,000,000,000 (five American billion) years.

The Sun has two unusual features because it is a fluid body. It rotates faster at its equator (about 25 days) than at its poles (about 33 days). We know this by observing another unusual feature of the Sun, its sunspots. Sunspots are dark areas on the Sun's surface. They are believed to be storms with magnetic activity. They increase and decrease over time, following the 11-year Sunspot Cycle. Sunspot activity on the Sun charges up our Earth's Ionosphere. The charged Ionosphere lets radio waves bounce more effectively back to Earth, and improves long distance radio coverage (especially in the shortwave radio bands). The Sunspot Cycle was at a maximum in 2001, and now is decreasing in its 11-year cycle.
