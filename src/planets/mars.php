				Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is commonly called the Red Planet. Mars has a reddish color from the iron oxide (rusted iron) on its surface. It orbits around the Sun in 687 days. The Martian day is a little longer than Earth's: 24 hours, 37 minues.

Mars is closer to the Earth in August 2003 than it has been in about 60,000 years. It appears much larger than anyone in recorded history has ever seen. This happens around its opposition to the Sun, which means it is 180° away from the Sun as seen from the Earth. When a planet is in opposition, you can see it rise approximately where the Sun rises, but 12 hours later. This makes the planet easy to locate, and visible during most of the evening. Anyone missing this will have to wait until the year 2287 for Mars to be this close again.

We are quickly learning more and more about Mars. NASA first launched the Mariner 4 spacecraft in 1964. Mariner 4 reached Mars and flew behind it (as seen from Earth) in July 1965. As the spacecraft flew around the planet, it sent radio signals back to Earth. NASA scientsts on Earth could take this information and calculate how much the signal was being refracted (bent) by the Martian atmosphere. Taking this data, these scientists estimated that the atmospheric pressure on the Martian surface was about 6 millibars (the atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface is a little over 1000 millibars).

NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft took images of the Martian surface and showed great differences between the northern and southern hemispheres. The northern hemisphere of Mars contains many volcanoes. The southern hemisphere contains many craters. The largest of these craters is Hellias, with a diameter of 1600 kilometers. Unfortunately, Mariner 9 arrived when a huge dust storm still had much of the planet enveloped in dust. This degraded image resolution, but the Viking spacecraft were able to photograph the surface afterwards.

The huge equatorial bulge on Mars is greatly affected by the Sun's gravitational attraction. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimates that Mars' axis tilt changes from 15° to 30° over a period of millions of years.

In 1976, two Viking spacecraft landed on Mars. As they landed, they sampled the Martian air. We know from these spacecraft that Martian air is approximately 96% Carbon Dioxide, 2.5% Nitrogen, 1.5% Argon 40, and 0.1% Oxygen. Martian atmosphere also contains Krypton, Xenon, Helium, and Neon. Planets have two major atmospheric layers, and upper layer and a lower layer. These layers are separated at an altitude known as the turbopause. Below the turbopause, atmospheric turbulence keeps all molecules mixed in their proportions. Above the turbopause, atmospheric turbulence isn't able to keep all atoms equally mixed, and lighter atoms rise above denser atoms. On Mars and the Earth, Hydrogen and Helium atoms above the turbopause are actually light enough to escape planetary gravity. The turbopause on Mars is at approximately 120 kilometers. On Earth, the turbopause is at approximately 105 kilometers.

The Viking landers sampled Martian soil and found a significant amount of sulfur. Magnets on the Viking landers allowed us to estimate that about 5% of Martian soil is magnetic. This is a very high amount. Martian soil has a lot of iron oxide, but does not appear to have much silicon.

NASA's Mars Global Surveyor entered into orbit around Mars in March of 1999. It is still sending pictures of the Martian surface back to Earth. The 23 June 2003 issue of USA Today reported that NASA's Mars Global Surveyor found water on Mars. The water lies approximately 500 feet below Mars' rocky surface. The surface of Mars is around -150 degrees Farenheit (-100 degrees Centigrade), but water appears to stay liquid below this cold surface.

Europe is sending its own Mars Express spacecraft to the poles of Mars. Its landing module the Beagle 2, will examine soil content on the surface and look for early signs of life. The lander is named after Charles Darwin's ship, the HMS Beagle. The Beagle is scheduled to land 26 December 2003.

NASA is sending two more landers, Spirit and Opportunity, to explore the surface of Mars. These two will land in January 2004. They will move around the equator of Mars during daylight hours, traveling about 300 feet per day. Like the European Beagle 2 lander, these two probes will search for early signs of life. They will send messages back to Earth through NASA's Mars Odyssey, which reached orbit around Mars in 2001.

Mars is more similar to the Earth than any other planet in the Solar System. Its day is just a little longer than ours (24 hours 37 minutes), and is tilted 25° on its axis (the Earth is tilted approximately 23.5° on its axis). Mars has wind and volcanoes. Its atmosphere is colder and much thinner than ours, but has wind and has clouds made of water vapor (and dry ice) around its polar caps. Mars does not have an Ozone (O3) layer similar to the Earth's. As a result, the Sun's unltraviolet radiation reaches the Martian surface about as strong as when it first enters the upper Martian atsmophere. Because Mars doesn't have oceans, sometimes its wind storms spread huge dust clouds around the planet.

In earlier times, Mars probably had liquid water on its surface and had rain. Today, most of Mars' water is trapped in polar ice caps that also contain dry ice (frozen Carbon Dioxide). There isn't enough water in the Martian atmosphere to cause rain. Clouds of dry ice can form around the polar ice caps. Because Carbon Dioxide sublimates (changes directly from gas to solid and back without a liquid or "steam" state), dry ice clouds above Mars have sharper edges than clouds of water vapor on Earth.

The gravity of Mars is about 38% that of Earth. In other words, if you weigh 100 kg on Earth, you will only weigh 38 kg on Mars.

In Greek mythology, Mars had two evil twin sons: Phobos (fear) and Deimos (terror). These are mentioned in the Iliad. In 1720, Jonathan Swift wrote of the planet Mars having two moons named Phobos and Deimos, and gave their orbit times within 30% — 157 years before they were discovered in 1877! When astronomers found that Mars did in fact have two moons, they of course named them Phobos and Deimos. Phobos and Deimos have irregular shapes, and were probably asteroids before entering into orbit around Mars.

The ancient Romans and Greeks named Mars after their mythological god of War because its red color resembled blood.
