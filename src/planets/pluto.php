				<span>Pluto is the ninth planet from the Sun. So far, it is the outermost planet discovered in our Solar System. Pluto has three unusual features. First, its orbit around the Sun (known as its inclination) is tilted more than any other planet  17 degrees. Second, when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is inside Neptune's orbit  but because its orbit is so tilted, it will never collide with Neptune. Third, all other planets from the Earth outward have a day of no more than 25 hours, but Pluto's day is about 6.4 of our days. The photograph at the left was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, in orbit around the Earth. It shows Pluto and its moon. This is the best photograph of Pluto ever taken.

Pluto has one known moon, Charon, discovered by James Christy in 1978. This moon is about 40% the size of Pluto. The mutual gravitational attraction of these two bodies, and their orbits in synchronization with each other, cause them to always face each other the same way.

Scientists now believe that Pluto is a Kuiper Belt Object, a remnant of the beginning of our Solar System. This is interesting in historical hindsight, because Gerard Kuiper himself thought that Pluto might have been an escaped moon of Neptune because its orbit was so tilted!

Pluto contains frozen nitrogen, and also hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. These are building blocks of life, and so Pluto contains valuable clues about the beginning of our Solar System.

NASA plans to launch a probe, the Pluto-Kuiper Express, in January 2006. This should reach Pluto and its moon Charon between 2015 an 2017. We will then have even more detailed images of Pluto and its moon than the Hubble Space Telescope can take. We will also learn much more about the features of Pluto and Charon, and about the materials they contain. The Pluto-Kuiper Express will then continue on its journey, reaching the Kuiper Belt (see below) before 2026.

Astronomers in the early 1800s found that the orbit of Uranus seemed to be affected by a more distant planet. Through mathematical prediction, they located Neptune. Neptune's orbit also seemed to be affected by a still more distant planet, and it wasn't big enough to cause the change observed in Uranus' orbit. Percival Lowell, a famous American astronomer of the late 1800s, tried in vain to find this planet. However, the planet was later discovered by someone working in an observatory bearing Lowell's name. Before then, by 1920, astronomers had given up hope in searching for the distant planet.

Then in the 1920s, a German (Carl Zeiss/Jena) invented a device for flipping back and forth between astronomical glass plates. (Astrophotographs were made on glass plates coated with sensitized photographic emulsion, because glass didn't warp like flexible film bases, and so could be used to accurately locate stellar positions.) They called this device the "blink comparator."
