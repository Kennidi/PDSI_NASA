				Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. It is the last planet visible by the unaided eye, and so was the last planet known to the ancients.

Saturn's most well known feature is its rings. These rings are made up of dust and rocks covered with ice. That is the same type of material found in comets. Scientists think the rings could have been formed from a comet striking one of Saturn's moons. There are thousands of rings, but they are divided into four main bands. They are (from nearest to furthest from the planet): the C Ring, the B Ring and the A Ring. There is a large gap between the A Ring and the B Ring, called Cassini's Division.

Galileo Galilei observed Saturn in the early 1600s and knew there was something different about its shape. Unfortunately, his telescopes were not powerful enough to show that Saturn had rings. In 1656, Christiaan Huygens developed a telescope that magnified objects 50 times their normal size and pointed it towards Saturn. With this much power, observers could clearly see that Saturn had rings that floated freely above the planet. A little later, in 1675, Giovanni Cassini discovered the large gap between Saturn's A Ring and B Ring.

Saturn has at least 18 moons. Its rings may contain more larger rocks that could be considered moons. The gravitational attraction of these moons keeps Saturn's rings orbiting the planet. some of these orbiting moons create the four large gap bands in Saturn's rings. The largest of these moons is Titan, second-largest moon in the Solar System (Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the largest in the Solar System).

Saturn's other moons are named after the family of Greek gods that their god Titan ruled.

Saturn's known moons are (from nearest to furthest from the planet): Pan, Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Epimetheus, Janus, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Telesto, Calypso, Dione, Helene, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Phoebe.

Saturn was the mythological Roman god of the harvest.
